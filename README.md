## Contact Book

This Python program is a simple contact management system that allows users to store, view, edit, and delete contacts. The contacts are saved in a file called contacts.txt and are loaded when the program starts. Users can add new contacts by entering a name, phone number, and email address, which are stored in a dictionary. The program also enables users to view all saved contacts, edit contact details, or delete a contact from the list. Changes are saved back to the file after every operation, ensuring that the contact list persists between sessions. The program runs through a menu interface, allowing users to choose different options for managing their contacts.
